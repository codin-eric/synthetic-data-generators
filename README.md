# Synthetic Data Generators (SDG)
SDG is a collection of common data challenges aimed at practicing and learning Data Engineering.  
Each generator simulates data behaviors modeled on real-life scenarios.


## Installation
Inside each folder you will find a data challenge with a generator and explanation on how to use it.

## TODO:
This is V0.1 of the open source project. In future I'd like to have an iniciative for people to contribute with new cases and potential solutions.

## Roadmap
[] Add more real-world scenarios
[] Build a community-driven challenge repository
