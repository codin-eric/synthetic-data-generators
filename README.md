# Synthetic Data Generators (SDG)
SDG is a collection of common data challenges aimed at practicing and learning Data Engineering.  
Each generator simulates data behaviors modeled on real-life scenarios.


This is V0.1 of the open source project. In future I'd like to have an iniciative for people to contribute with new cases and potential solutions.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to provide generators that help test and practice common **data engineering challenges**.  

This project is not aimed at **data analysis, business intelligence, or data science** challenges. 

## Project structure 
Inside each folder you will find a data challenge with a generator and explanation on how to use it.

## Roadmap
- Add more real-world scenarios
- Build a community-driven challenge repository
